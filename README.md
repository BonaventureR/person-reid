# Person Re-ID

This repo experiments with cross-data evaluation from pre-existing datasets such as Market1501 and CUKH-03 on our collected dataset. 

These experiments utilize the TorchReid Library created by Kaiyang Zhou <https://kaiyangzhou.github.io/deep-person-reid/> as a means to test Cross-Entropy and Triplet Loss Function's effects on mAP, and rank accuracies on collected datasets.
